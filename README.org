* Bookmarklets

My custom bookmarklets.

** Building

For now just copy them to your command line

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
npm run build; echo "javascript:$(cat dist/slack-discord.js)" | pbcopy
#+END_SRC

** Scripts

*** Slack / Discord

Goes to the latest unread message on either slack or discord.

Practical when bound to a hotkey, to quickly switch to the latest messages.
